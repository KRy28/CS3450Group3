Plan sprint 2 dev:
Plan Sprint 1 Dev: 

Beginning and end:
Ends: ~March 15 (spring break makes this weird Mabye closer to the 22cd?)
Hours: in meeting 3, out meeting 6 for 9*4 = 36 hours (assuming 3 meetings and 2 hr work between meetings) we had 5 last time so ~27 may be more accurate.
We will all be available to work, will probably need to meet over discord due to meeting places and transportation. Except no directed work over the break.
Metric for retrospective: learning and work done? Idk

Benson is Scrum Master.
